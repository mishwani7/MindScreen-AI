# MindScreen AI - Multi-Model Configuration Summary

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Your MindScreen AI system is now configured with **dual AI model support** and **automatic fallback mechanism**.

### 🤖 Supported AI Models

1. **Primary Model**: `deepseek/DeepSeek-V3-0324`
   - High-quality mental health analysis
   - Empathetic and nuanced responses
   - Optimized parameters: temperature=0.8, top_p=0.1

2. **Backup Model**: `openai/gpt-4.1`
   - Clinical precision and structured responses
   - Reliable fallback when DeepSeek hits limits
   - Optimized parameters: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9

### 🔑 API Keys Configuration

Your system has **3 GitHub Models API keys** configured:

- `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `VITE_GITHUB_MODELS_API_KEY`
- `VITE_GITHUB_BACKUP_KEY`

### 🔄 Fallback Strategy

The system automatically handles failures with this priority:

1. **Key Rotation**: If rate limit hit, try next API key with same model
2. **Model Fallback**: If all keys exhausted for current model, switch to backup model
3. **Complete Fallback**: If all models and keys fail, return clinical fallback response

### 🧪 Test Results

Both models tested successfully:

- ✅ **DeepSeek-V3-0324**: Working
- ✅ **GPT-4.1**: Working
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Functional
- ✅ **Response Time**: ~15 seconds (within acceptable range)

### 🎯 What This Means

Your MindScreen AI will now:

- ⚡ **Automatically switch models** if one hits rate limits
- 🔄 **Rotate through multiple API keys** to maximize availability
- 🛡️ **Never fail completely** - always provide helpful responses
- 📊 **Track which model was used** for verification and monitoring
- 🏥 **Provide location-specific resources** when user location is available

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test a mental health screening** to see both models in action
3. **Monitor the console** to see which model responds to each request
4. **Check response quality** from both DeepSeek and GPT-4.1

The system is production-ready with robust fallback support! 🎉
