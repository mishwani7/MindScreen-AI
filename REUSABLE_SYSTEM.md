class NewScreenerProcessor extends BaseAssessmentProcessor<NewScreenerResult> {
  // Implement required methods
}

// 2. Use in screener page
const processor = new NewScreenerProcessor()
const results = await processor.processAssessment(responses, userProfile)

// 3. Display results
<ComprehensiveResults result={results} onReset={resetAssessment} />
```
